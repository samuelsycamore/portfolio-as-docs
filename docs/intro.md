# Sam Sycamore's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!
I'm Sam Sycamore, a writer, editor, and open-source docs maintainer with over ten years of professional experience across multiple industries.

I help SaaS startups and digital agencies clearly communicate the value of their products and services to their target users.
I especially enjoy writing educational content for tech products, because I believe that strong docs are the best marketing materials you can present to the developer community.

I currently work as a technical writer, copywriter, and developer advocate in the tech industry.
I'm always happy to consider new clients for writing work.
Feel free to [get in touch via email](mailto:samatsycamoredotgarden) if you'd like to work with me.

This portfolio gathers highlights from across my career as a writer.
