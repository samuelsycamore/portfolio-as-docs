## Hashnode call to action

[Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) is blogging platform for writers in the tech industry.
In 2021, I served as the company's first Marketing Manager.

Software engineers are notoriously difficult to market to, because they tend to be exceptionally skeptical of anything that resembles traditional marketing.

At Hashnode, I cultivated a voice and tone to speak to users as one of their peers‚Äîa knowledgeable colleague who's been around the block and wants to give you his honest opinion.
This voice is confident without being pushy, and reassuring without being patronizing.

I wrote a great deal of marketing copy during my time at Hashnode, but the call to action below remains one of my favorite pieces. 
I think it perfectly encapsulates both the company's primary value propositions, as well as the voice and tone that I created for the company.
