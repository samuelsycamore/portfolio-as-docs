## Axiom onboarding tutorials

[Axiom](https://axiom.ai) is a Y-Combinator-backed startup that offers a no-code browser automation tool targeted at small business owners and solopreneurs.

Though the product does not require the user to write code, their success with it hinges on their understanding of some core programming concepts.

The founders of Axiom approached me to create educational materials that they could publish to help onboard new users.

I proposed a tutorial series covering three projects of increasing complexity to introduce the user to the UI and get them thinking about how they could incorporate browser automation into their business workflow.
Along the way, I would explain necessary programming concepts in terms that a non-technical person could understand.

These tutorials became the first articles published to the Axiom Academy resource hub:

- I. [Automate Your Morning Routine](https://academy.axiom.ai/blog/automate-your-morning-routine.html)
- II. [Let Browser Bots Handle Your Meal Planning](https://academy.axiom.ai/blog/automate-your-meal-planning.html)
- III. [Clean Up Your Cluttered Inbox](https://academy.axiom.ai/blog/clean-up-your-cluttered-inbox.html)
