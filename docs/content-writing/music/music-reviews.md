Ma Turner - _ZOZ_ (2014)

The most common criticism leveled against experimental music by the less open-minded usually comes down to something like “this isn’t even music; it’s just noise.” For some, this is the most damning thing you can say about an artist’s work: You attempted to make art, but this does not even register as art to me. But how is one to discuss the merits of a piece of music when its creator flatly admits that during the creative process he “eventually stopped caring if what I was making was even music”?

This question has been nagging me ever since I took on the fool’s errand of reviewing Ma Turner’s ZOZ, an LP of 13 abbreviated pieces culled from eight hours' worth of, err, music (we’ll call it that for the sake of simplicity) found on the original ZOZ Collection's 12 cassettes. Those tapes, in turn, were pieced together from a year of nightly recording sessions in which Ma would lose himself to the meditative process of creating sound for sound's sake, sometimes not even bothering to listen to the playback while overdubbing new sounds over the old, simply letting his intuition and the physical joy of repetitive movement guide his creation.

That joy manifests itself as divine on cyclical opener “Christ In A Garden”, which is one of the few pieces of evidence we’re given that Turner truly is capable of writing a gorgeous and moving “song” if he so chooses. After repeat listens, “Christ” feels like a thematic, if not sonic summation of the record as a whole: seeking transcendence through the creative process, ripping your ego from its shell for a scant few hours at a time in order to weave yourself fully into the fabric of the void that won’t stop calling your name.

While the music itself can be seen as a sort of meditative diary, ZOZ is patently not meant to soundtrack your meditation sesh. Believe me, I tried. Whenever I felt as though I was approaching that holy emptiness, losing myself to Turner’s secondhand hypnosis, something like the deep rumbling of planes overhead in “Rash Harvest”, or a swarm of bees in “On Clock Sniper” would take over the mix and jolt me back to the earthly realm. The otherworldly undulations remind: “Stay grounded.”

The closest that Turner comes to exploring terrestrial sentiments comes on “I Love To See You Brother”, another simple acoustic guitar “song” in the vein of “Christ” amid the warped, looping phrases of unknown origin that sandwich it. The title suggests a distinct subject, an individual, but given Turner’s belief in “a shared ‘power source’ amongst all living things,” the titular “Brother” could very well have its definition expanded to include all of creation.

In the end, that’s what you get when you give ZOZ a spin: all of creation. A critic’s job, ultimately, is to determine what an artist intended to do, and then decide whether or not they succeeded. But stripped of its mythology, ZOZ is impenetrable, which befits an uncompromising portrait of a prolific artist seeking a spark of the divine in foreign territory. In that sense it wholly exceeds the promises laid out by its statement of intent. You are not invited to join Ma Turner as he disappears into the Zoz, but you’re welcome, and encouraged, to take pictures from the sidelines.

… It’s Jayle Time

BY SAM BENANTI

Jaye Jayle is the boozehound alter ego of Evan Patterson, best known as the frontman of the vicious rock group Young Widows. But fans of Patterson’s other band, Old Baby, will find the most to love here, as … It’s Jayle Time offers a more stripped-down version of the psychedelic blues sound that band does so well. This singer-songwriter project is better suited to a ghost town saloon than a coffee shop open mic, with spacious, hypnotic acoustic strums evoking the sort of desperate loneliness that can only arise after sufficient time spent alone with one’s demons on a desolate landscape. Sure, the spoken-word “Introduction” is kinda corny, but it’s worth indulging Jayle and his merry band of Jaylebyrds in order to properly set the scene for this impressive, loosely conceptual collection of ramblin’ tunes.

Black Kaspar - _Schizo-Tech_ (2014)

Louisville-based free improv group Black Kaspar aim to shred your skull with Schizo-Tech, the latest crazed masterpiece to ooze forth from the tape label known as Loin Seepage. Leader Bill Zink guides his backing band, which features members of longstanding Louisville-via-Bloomington institution Sick City Four, through a dense array of spaced-out drone peppered with moments of sludgy, free-form jazz.

While previous transmissions from Black Kaspar were crafted with little regard to fidelity, Schizo-Tech offers a clearer portrait of the group, with much of the in-the-red fuzz having been lifted to give the individual instruments their own space in the mix. The tracks here are quite a bit lengthier than much of the BK discography, demonstrating an ensemble that’s grown quite comfortable pushing themselves as far out as they can possibly travel. The Sick City Four have been doing this together for decades now, but Schizo-Tech is Black Kaspar’s strongest offering to date due to its skillful marriage of SCF’s free-jazz explorations with Zink’s abrasive, alienating noise. It’s also their most cohesive, thanks to a clearly defined sound palette that thematically aligns each of the three pieces.

Just when you think you’ve got the 23-minute opener “Space Truckin’ Part II” figured out, an overdriven bass guitar cuts through the muck around the seven-minute mark and leads the band on a sonic journey that almost hits like prog rock if, say, the members of King Crimson had their souls sucked out and replaced by extraterrestrials with unclear motives. The title track lives up to its deranged moniker, eschewing drums – or really anything resembling a musical instrument – in favor of a bubbling, frothing pool of feedback and white/black noise.

“Burrowing” takes up all of side B, coming on like a few too many doses of acid kicking in all at once, and proceeds to saw at the skull with a pulsating wall of sound. But that’s just to prepare your brain for the track’s vicious percussion assault, which hammers away just long enough to soften up your squishy gray head meat and mold it into hamburger patties, which are then fed to your neighbors as the tape comes to a close. And dammit if they aren’t delicious.

Branches - _Casa Nossa_ (2014)

Casa Nossa is the latest cassette from Portuguese artist Pedro “”Branches” Rios (whose previous tape, Ninguém É Como Tu” , was named one of the best of 2012 by Impose), in which he conjures up a series of dreamy spaces to occupy using fluttering, meditative New-Age synth drones and ecstatic vocoder chants. Casa Nossa is Branches at his most serene; the only darkness to be found here lies in the two-part ode to a Japanese fruit, “Yuzu”, which brings to mind star-gazing through a telescope with dilated pupils.

The more expansive “Yuzu #2” (appearing in the video below) features some fittingly Fripp-like, e-bowed guitar flourishes. Meanwhile, the title track is a sticky-sweet loop of sunny yé-yé pop, though the approach is more Göttsching than Gainsbourg. This is wallpaper music of the highest order — you can trust Branches to take you through each room with the care of a gracious host.

Young Widows - "Kerosene Girl" (2014)

Louisville’s Young Widows deliver a loving punch to the face this week with “Kerosene Girl”, the lead single from their forthcoming LP Easy Pain.

Many of the band’s best songs explore the dotted line between pain and pleasure, built around a groovy noise-rock spine that reflects the sexiness inherent in violence. “Kerosene Girl” fits that mold quite well, and serves as a welcome reappraisal of Young Widows’ aggressive roots, which were dialed back significantly on 2011’s In And Out Of Youth And Lightness.

Frontman Evan Patterson is in rare form, his lurching, self-destructive swagger counterbalanced by the gut-punching rhythm section. And if you thought this thing was heavy as shit at the ten-second mark (it is), then prepare to cower in fear as Patterson’s ferocious wall of guitars bite and claw their way into the mix during the song’s explosive finale.

BLACK BIRDS OF PARADISE

BY SAM BENANTI

Black Birds of Paradise arrive fully formed on their debut, merging elements of jazz fusion, surf rock and pastoral folk under the banner of prog-leaning psych rock. This must be the work of music school geeks gone rogue — you won’t hear such expert chord changes out of any local peers, and they set themselves apart in the timbre department by way of a prominent vibraphone. So prominent, in fact, that it threatens to drown out the real action on tunes like “Western Song,” which features some sweet guitar licks that aren’t given the front-and-center treatment they deserve. There’s also a fair amount of humor here, but that humor can be hit or miss; the B-movie screams on “Cannibal Song” feel appropriate, but cringe-worthy lyrics on the knowing “Let’s Make Sex Together” undermine what is otherwise a killer instrumental.

Nmesh - _Nu.wav Hallucinations_ (2013)

Vaporwave: the latest unholy micro-genre currently oozing from the detritus piled up in forgotten corners of the Internet. Its mission statement: Repurpose fragments of commercial Muzak and recontextualize them into something that both reflects and skewers pop culture. But where other purveyors of vapor emphasize the cold, lifeless nature of their samples, Nmesh operates from a place of nostalgic, wide-eyed playfulness that sets him apart from his peers. Alex Koenig clearly adores all of his source material, from wholesale appropriations of Billy Idol and Kenny G to bizarre YouTube audio rips (as on the highly unsettling “ΞΛT THΞ ΞGGS ЭЭЭ”). From mundane, kitschy sources, Nu.wav Hallucinations dredges up sincere terror and hilarity in equal measure. This is elevator music for a hazy, hallucinatory fever dream; psychedelia for the post-singularity techno-future.

Daughn Gibson - _Me Moan_ (2013)

Pick your favorite DJ software, load it up with dusty country samples and electronic beats, and then do your best drunken Elvis impression on top of it all. If that sounds absolutely disastrous on paper, then it’s all the more to Daughn Gibson’s credit that his peculiar brand of electro-country trucker ballads is not only listenable, but actually quite beautiful. Ever the barstool poet, Gibson’s lyrics alternate between unrequited loves and bathroom-stall hookups, both approached from a default state of deep melancholy. His surly baritone is still the focal point of the music, and also perhaps its most divisive element — it can be grating at times when he piles on the twangy affectation a little too thick. But Me Moan is uncompromising in its insistence that the listener dive headfirst into its world — tonight, it’s all or nothing. Won’t you come for a ride, baby?

Omar Souleyman - _Wenu Wenu_ (2013)
published in: LEO Weekly Magazine

Omar Souleyman, master of the high-energy Arab dance music style known as dabke, is said to have over 500 official releases to his name. His legendary wedding performances in Syria have been endlessly taped and bootlegged for almost twenty years, and yet Wenu Wenu is Souleyman’s very first proper studio record. His band’s twenty-first century dabke sound, which merges traditional instrumentation with electronic synthesizers and sequencers, is rendered here with a level of clarity never before heard by audiences outside of the Middle East. Each of the album’s seven tracks rides its own unique but relentless groove, over which Souleyman alternately pleads and howls while the electric saz conjures up hypnotic, intoxicating leads. How fortunate we are to have this accessible entry point into the labyrinthine work of this enigmatic figure.

House Ghost - _Physical Education_ (2013)
published in: LEO Weekly Magazine

Like a half-remembered episode of “Pete & Pete,” House Ghost’s Physical Education EP is a breezy and innocent helping of comfort food, bursting with the same oddball charm that made that TV show a cult favorite. And though steeped in the lineage of ’90s alt-rock radio, the group’s sense of mass-appeal melody recalls the music one might hear over the course of a Nick at Nite binge, from “Dick Van Dyke” all the way through “Happy Days.” Clear standout “Television” is an earworm begging for a commercial spot, but it’s the knowing, self-deprecating humor present in the lyrics that really sells it. Only on opener “Snacks for Two” does the band fumble, crossing that dreaded line from “cute” to “cutesy.” The cast of “Salute Your Shorts” understood that an awful waffle has to sting a little to be effective.

AlunaGeorge - _Body Music_ (2013)

Pop music doesn’t get much more pleasurable. Producer George Reid skillfully draws from many of dance music’s hottest trends, from deep house to trap to U.K. garage, all framed within tried-and-true Top 40 structures. But it’s the “will-she-or-won’t-she” femme fatale persona of singer Aluna Francis that really makes the duo shine, as on breakout single “You Know You Like It.” If you squint, it’s not hard to imagine songs like “Body Music” or “Your Drums, Your Love” being long-lost collaborations between Timbaland and Aaliyah. The only misstep is the cover of Montell Jordan’s “This Is How We Do It,” primarily because it forces Aluna out of her carefully crafted persona. But overall, Body Music is a gratifying and thoroughly corporeal affair — don’t bother with that pesky brain. Just shake those hips already.

M.I.A. - _Matangi_ (2013)

After alienating mainstream fans with the puzzling, atonal / \ / \ / \ Y / \, M.I.A. retreats to well-trodden territory on Matangi. Bass-heavy, collage-style production takes cues from international dance styles and old-school American hip-hop, while Maya’s verses, as usual, vary from insightful critique to cringe-worthy clumsiness. Thankfully, this one is far more melodic than its predecessor, and singles like “Come Walk With Me” and “Y.A.L.A.” hold their own when stacked up against previous successes. But many of the more experimental cuts fail to make much of an impression, and M.I.A.’s one-note flow wears out its welcome before the album’s hour is up. There’s a strong, intelligent dance record within Matangi — it just requires a little trimming.

LOUISVILLE EXPERIMENTAL FESTIVAL PUTS WORTHY MUSIC IN CONTEXT
JUN
25
2014
BY SAM BENANTI

Straddling the line between high and low art, between dive bars and academia, between rigid classical training and anything-goes improvisation, Louisville’s experimental musicians explore the outer limits of sonic possibilities at a pace rivaling that of major metropolitan hotspots — whether anyone listens or not.

“It’s enormous,” says Joee Conroy, founding member of the longstanding, self-proclaimed “pan-idiomatic free jazz” group Ut Gret. “It’s the equivalent of what New York City was in 1977 and 1978. It’s that big, and it’s better, because there are no real weak points. We’re blessed in that we have so much creative energy and talent, and cursed in that there’s not much of an audience for it. But because there is no audience, that may be why there’s so much talent. You have to make music you’re convinced is worth doing. Otherwise, there’s no point.”

The accepted definition of “experimental” music is about as vague as it seems, essentially boiling down to the tried-and-true “I know it when I see it” approach. Some musicians meticulously plan out each note, mood and texture, while others simply gather their favorite collaborators together with a pile of noisemaking tools and see what they can conjure up in the moment. Yet the city’s collective of artists, organizers and promoters offer each other a great deal of support, despite only the loosest conceptual leanings threading through each individual’s contributions.

“To me, there’s really no such thing as ‘experimental’ music, per se,” says Joel Hunt, who books concerts as The Other Side of Life and operates the venue Dreamland with his business partner, percussionist Tim Barnes. “All music that’s worth anything, in my opinion, takes some sort of risk or crosses the limitations of some sort of boundary — whether those limits are imposed by time or, sheesh, any number of other things. Context is everything.”

Barnes knows a great deal about context. Before relocating with his family to Louisville in 2007, he made a name for himself in NYC’s burgeoning free improv scene in the ’90s, primarily in and around John Zorn’s circle of collaborators. After countless years of improvising with some of the most proficient and prolific artists in this realm, Barnes still vividly recalls his first encounter with this sort of risk-taking music while attending New York’s inaugural Vision Festival for free jazz and other improvised music in 1993.

“It fundamentally altered my trajectory,” he recalls with a broad smile. “I went from listening to Sebadoh to Stockhausen overnight.”

Late last year, Barnes and Hunt saw a real opportunity when they learned that the Louisville Film Society had moved out of Dreamland, the small, pew-adorned theater behind Decca on East Market Street. Barnes began booking low-key concerts and film screenings there, and some casual talk of a partnership with Hunt quickly grew serious.

“It’s been a lot of work, with a huge learning curve and a lot of obstacles thrown in our way, probably even more than people realize,” admits Hunt. “And it’s a long way from paying for itself. But Dreamland, or at least a place like it, needs to exist in a city the size of Louisville. We’re not a small town anymore, nor are we a place that should pride itself on ignoring what the rest of the world has to offer.”

This weekend, Dreamland will host the three-day Louisville Experimental Festival, now in its fourth year of operation. Organizer Douglas Lucas saw a clear need for an annual event that focused specifically on presenting artists within experimental, improvisational, noise and related genres shortly after relocating here in 2008, and set out “to celebrate the city’s rich musical diversity as well as to help enhance it by bringing more national experimental artists to Louisville.”

This year promises to be the festival’s biggest yet, and true to Lucas’ vision, it will host a wide range of both local and world-renowned musicians. Among the out-of-towners are New York avant-garde turntablist Maria Chavez, who recently spun her carefully curated magic at MoMA, and John Wiese, the free-noise sound designer and composer whose colossal discography could fill an entire museum, representing L.A.

But those in the know are perhaps even more excited about this year’s local offerings. Astro Black Records’ owner Jim Marlowe will be improvising in a horn trio with local players Steve Good (Ut Gret, Crappy Nightmareville) and Dan Willems (The Belgian Waffles!, Sick City Four); multi-instrumentalist Joee Conroy will improvise in a trio featuring Misha Feigin and Jackie Royce, and, as with the aforementioned trio, this will be their first live performance in this arrangement. Tim Barnes is scheduled to collaborate with Arizona’s Jeph Jerman, whose live performance typically involves the manipulation of field recordings and objects found in nature — from stones to shells to driftwood.

While experimental music is often unfairly written off as pretentious, or more conceptual than musical, in practice there is little that matches the in-the-moment excitement of watching a group of musicians feed off each other’s energy and create a piece of music in front of you that can never be replicated outside of that single performance. The key, says Barnes, is to allow yourself to be open to the experience as a listener.

The same goes for the musicians, too. There’s a common misconception, Conroy notes, that improvising musicians are simply so skilled with their instruments that they’ve left the earthly realm of music behind, with only passing concerns for quaint notions like “chords” or “melodies” — call it “The Coltrane Effect.” The truth is that anyone can improvise, and the best part is, you don’t even need instruments.

Douglas Lucas, who performs under the name Mu, says his creative process is all about “turning everything on and then seeing what transpires.”

“Mu is all about improvisation,” Lucas explains. “Every recording and performance is done spontaneously. In most cases, I decide what instruments and/or non-instruments I’m going to use only a few hours beforehand; I’ve used guitars, hammers, oscillators, plastics, tape, knives, turntables, synthesizers, rocks, etc., etc. Sometimes I play with an ensemble that consists of rotating members who play various instruments such as sax, guitar, drums, electronics and so on.”

?During the LEF, Lucas will join local improvisers Norman Minogue, Mike French and Thaniel Ion Lee to play behind Steve Good, who will be giving a rare reading of his surrealist poetry. While all this talk of jazz, noise and the avant-garde may leave some people feeling out of the loop, it doesn’t take any high-minded notions or special knowledge to enjoy the adventure of watching artists tap into their deepest creative impulses right before your eyes. Joel Hunt hopes that Dreamland — and the artists who perform under its roof — will help lay that misconception to rest.

“So-called ‘experimental’ or ‘weird’ music is not something only academic types can or do enjoy,” says Hunt. “Same with film or visual art or any other type of performance art. I didn’t come from a particularly astute musical family myself, so I definitely think exposing people to what they otherwise might miss out on is a big motivating factor for making Dreamland work.”

Different beats, different beasts: Merchandise’s beautiful mess
JUN

2014
BY SAM BENANTI

Signing with British record label 4AD was just one of several paradigm-shifting decisions recently made by Tampa, Fla., indie rockers Merchandise, who also picked up two new permanent members in the time since last year’s LP Totale Nite. But the band hasn’t lost sight of its DIY sensibilities in the process of making their third full-length, After the End, which guitarist Dave Vassalotti says is their most intentionally straightforward pop record to date.

“Home recording is all we really know,” admits Vassalotti, who is part of the core founding trio that also includes singer Carson Cox and bassist Patrick Brady. “Even though we’re on a reputable label and have a budget for the first time ever, we could never have made this record in a real studio. All the hours of recording, re-recording, cutting, arranging … it would have cost a million dollars. It took a continuous six months to complete. We work best at our own pace.”

The band also seems to work best in close quarters. All five members, including new additions Elsner Nino on drums and Chris Horn on saxophone, also live together. “It seems insane,” remarks Vassalotti, “but somehow it works.” Now that the band is successful enough that its members don’t have to work side jobs anymore, they’ve got plenty of time to indulge in home recording experiments. Cox takes the lead as producer.

“We recorded After the End in Carson’s bedroom and closet,” says Vassalotti. “Nothing fancy. His knowledge as a producer has grown considerably since we started as a band. You can hear it get better on each record. After the End is definitely the ‘cleanest’ and most ‘pro’ sounding recording we’ve made yet, but it still maintains a certain rawness.”

All of those characteristics are on full display in lead single “Little Killer,” especially in the faux-glossy, deliberately sloppy music video, directed by Cox. Yet the musical style has been boiled down to its essential elements, with the cavernous space found on previous records walled off in order to pack in the endlessly pleasurable pop hooks that much more tightly.

Stylistically speaking, however, the band has no intention of burning bridges, as is evident on “Begging for Your Life/In the City Light,” their introductory 12-inch release for 4AD earlier this year. The sprawling, 12-minute jam, built around an afternoon improv session recorded while “under a heavy hashish spell,” was originally created for a limited-run split cassette with Chelsea Light Moving, Thurston Moore’s post-Sonic Youth project.

“‘Begging’ is probably my favorite song of ours,” says Vassalotti. “I’d love to do more pieces like that in the future. We’ve had our share of long songs in the past, and since we wrote After the End to be some sort of a ‘pop’ record, doing that 12-inch temporarily satisfied the itch for extended long-form jams.”

Cox, Brady and Vassalotti worked as a trio for several years before bringing Elsner and Horn on board, and earlier tours made heavy use of drum machines and pre-recorded loops to make up for the personnel gaps. While some fans may lament the loss of that humbler lo-fi aesthetic, the band couldn’t be happier with this new, more organic approach to live performance.

“Playing with a human drummer feels so much better than playing to samplers and drum machines,” Vassalotti admits, while noting that “studio Merch and live Merch have always been two different beasts. The dynamics have changed mostly in the live realm.”

“We never spent too much time reimagining the old material,” he continues, “but now that we’ve played those songs so many times, we’re trying to change things up a bit for the sake of our own sanity. Chris, our newest member, is playing rhythm guitar and keyboards live now. The songs are starting to fill out in a real nice way. I’d really love to do a live record one of these days …”

With seven months off since Merchandise’s last lengthy tour, Vassalotti says he has become “a bit stir-crazy. I enjoy the comforts of home life — I have a girlfriend and a massive wall of records to keep me company — but travel and exploration are important and necessary.”

But no matter how far the group ventures from their local scene in Florida, they’ll always be working-class punks trying to forge meaningful connections by way of their beautifully messy art-pop.

Reap what you sow

When LEO first met White Reaper in 2012, they were a modest-yet-promising two-piece punk band eagerly anticipating their debut performance; a year and a half later, they’re a ferocious power trio who just landed their first record deal, and they’ve got their sights set on the national stage.

Originally composed of drummer Nick Wilkerson and singer/guitarist Anthony Esposito, the band wisely picked up Nick’s twin brother Sam to cover the bass guitar shortly after they self-released their seven-inch single “Conspirator” (backed with “The Cut”) in the summer of 2013. That summer and fall saw the boys mounting multiple tours of the Midwest while regularly performing to an ever-expanding crowd of devoted followers in town.

“We’ve played some pretty cool shows on tour, but to be honest, the coolest shows we’ve played have been in town,” says Esposito, citing recent gigs at Haymarket Whiskey Bar and Fresh Start Growers’ Supply as especially memorable. He admits the band was left “awestruck” by their first trip to New York City earlier this month.

They will have plenty more opportunities to surpass those successes this summer, when they’ll open for fellow Louisvillians Young Widows across a 15-gig tour of the West Coast. That tour just happens to coincide with the June 24 release of the Reap’s self-titled EP for Polyvinyl Records. The EP’s six tracks were culled from recording sessions with Trip Barringer of Treehouse Audio and Jim Marlowe of Astro Black Records, and is grabbing the attention of listeners thanks to the premiere of lead single “Half Bad” on Pitchfork.

When I ask the guys how they landed the record deal, they cheekily explain to me that their friend Tobey Maguire (of “Spiderman”) made the critical introductions. While I have a hard time believing that these underage hooligans know many Hollywood types just yet, the truth is that White Reaper’s killer tunes speak for themselves; it was never a matter of whether the right people would take notice, only when.

The imaginary world of Washed Out
BY SAM BENANTI
The music of Ernest Greene, as Washed Out, is about as calm and dreamy as pop music gets, which is how he ended up as the poster child of the synth-heavy, reverb-soaked “chillwave” movement of the late aughts. And while his sophomore full-length, Paracosm, is his most laid-back offering yet, it bears little resemblance to the lo-fi bedroom demos of his early EPs.

For one thing, Washed Out has made the jump from solo laptop project to full-fledged band in the intervening years and now features Greene’s wife on keyboards.

“What we’re doing now is by far the most rock-leaning set I’ve ever done, mainly because the lineup is a traditional rock band setup,” explains Greene. “I still write by myself, but for the first time (with Paracosm), I was very much writing for the band and the live show, which is much different than what I’ve done before. I’m really thinking about each member’s strengths and weaknesses.”

Compared to his debut full-length, 2011’s Within & Without, the new album is much brighter. “I keep saying it’s a daytime album,” says Greene. The word “paracosm” refers to an imaginary realm, and Paracosm was written shortly after he and his wife relocated to an idyllic cottage in rural Georgia.

“It’s by far the nicest setup we’ve ever had,” Greene gushes. “I have my own dedicated studio space now. That was a big inspiration for the album, and kind of a paracosm of its own. We were so busy for the last couple years before, traveling and being in the spotlight. It was nice to get out to the country and do our own thing. It was a very content time, and I guess it came out through the music.”

While writing Paracosm, Greene was first exposed to the life and work of outsider artist Henry Darger, who he came to identify with as a sort of kindred spirit. Darger became famous posthumously after the discovery of his 15,000-page fantasy manuscript, accompanied by hundreds of drawings and paintings meant to flesh out the story.

“I just read a lot about his life and tried to dig up as much of his artwork as I could,” Greene says. “I definitely drew some parallels between what I was doing and what he was doing. He was a reclusive artist — no one really knew, in his life, that he was doing this artwork, and it wasn’t until he passed away that it was found. He was never trained, and so he created his own process to put together his artwork. Because of that, it’s very unique and stands apart from anything else I’ve seen.

“I like to think of my work kind of like that,” he continues. “I taught myself, and because of that, I approach things from a slightly weird perspective.”

Being self-taught does come with its fair share of difficulties. Though he already had a few smaller releases under his belt by the time he cut his first proper album, Greene faced a great deal of challenges during the process.

“The hardest part with Within & Without was dealing with my own insecurities, the pressure I put on myself. Having gone through that, I knew how to deal with it a little better (when writing Paracosm). The process went a lot smoother. I had a strong idea of what I wanted Paracosm to sound like, so it was like filling in pieces of the puzzle of that picture I had in my head. Within was more of a trial-and-error process — trying things out and stumbling upon ideas randomly.”

That clear and focused vision on the big picture is what separates Paracosm from the rest of the Washed Out discography. Live instrumentation and acoustic guitars round out the trademark synthesizer washes, and the obscurant wall of reverb once found on Greene’s vocals has been softened, allowing his peaceful, stream-of-consciousness lyrics to shine through.

Greene feels fortunate to be able to share the stage with his band. “(When I started out), there were some parts about performing solo I really liked, and other parts I didn’t. Then the shows got bigger and bigger ... I felt confident to perform by myself in the smaller clubs, but once I got to the festivals, it felt more comfortable for me having a band. That interaction on stage really feeds into the audience and the overall vibe.”

Drop it

Up-and-coming house DJ Vancington isn’t too happy with Louisville’s dance music scene. “Honestly, I hate most of it,” admits 21-year-old Alan Vance. “I’ve been to a few parties where the music, people, vibe — everything was awful. It’s saturated with music I really hate. The whole EDM thing makes my skin crawl.”

Fortunately for those of us who like to shake our hips on the regular, Vancington is the proactive type, and his stellar remixes and original productions suggest a better way forward. His latest tune, “Baby, It’s You,” which lifts its titular vocal hook from Jenny Burton’s 1985 single “Bad Habits,” is a smart, sexy track that never succumbs to the cliché trappings of modern dance production.

Despite his reservations about the local scene, Vancington is the first to admit there’s plenty of talent to be found in Louisville. “Between Amtrac, Glam Shell, Space Laces and more, there is world-class electronic music coming from this city. And there are people keeping great music alive, with staples like Zanzabar Fridays and Louisville’s (monthly) techno party, Pitch.”

Vance found salvation from cookie-cutter mainstream EDM in the realm of house music, after developing an interest in four-on-the-floor electro through France’s Ed Banger Records. One of the main appeals, for him, was the absence of “the drop”: that predictable moment, prevalent in dubstep, where the beat accelerates until it drops off a cliff, only to reemerge on the next downbeat with extra bass aggression. House music was subtler, “more about a groove and a build rather than a drop, blowing everything at once.”

Vancington plans to drop his debut EP early next year. On Dec. 21, the DJ will host a charity concert at the Alley Theater in Butchertown, with entry granted in exchange for canned or otherwise non-perishable food items to be donated. “I’ve never done an event like this before,” says Vance, “but the motivation was to have the music pull people into doing some good, and to have a great time doing so.”
