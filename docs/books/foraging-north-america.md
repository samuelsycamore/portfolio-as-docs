## Foraging North America

Foraging North America is a 12-week course designed to arm you with a functional working knowledge of botany and taxonomy that you can take with you out onto the land to fast-track the ID process and boost your confidence when foraging.

My mission in creating this program is to promote ecological literacy alongside an ethos of _conservation through use_â€”the (surprisingly) radical notion that humans can, in fact, have a positive impact on the environments that we move through. 

_Foraging North America_ is available in [The Good Life Revival shop](https://thegoodliferevival.com/shop/fna).
