## Introduction to Foraging

In 2016 I launched [The Good Life Revival](https://thegoodliferevival.com), a blog and podcast focused on homesteading, gardening, permaculture, ecology, and related topics.

As my audience grew, I discovered a need within the community for high-quality information about edible wild plants.

Most of the existing resources online were either too "folksy" or else too scientific and academic.

I set out to bridge the gap with [_Introduction to Foraging: A Beginner's Guide to Gathering Wild Foods With Confidence_](https://shop.sycamore.garden/l/introduction-to-foraging), self-published in early 2018.

The book consists of two main parts: first, a broad introduction to the topic of foraging; and second, a review of 12 of the most common species and genera of edible wild plants in North America and Europe.

_Introduction to Foraging_ enabled to me to make a name for myself as a reputable source for practical and well-researched information about wild foods.

I would go on to tutor dozens of students from all over the United States and Canada on this topic through my Wild Food Mentorship program in 2019.

I followed up this book in 2019 with my online course, _Foraging North America: the Botany, Taxonomy, and Ecology of Edible Wild Plants_.

_Introduction to Foraging_ was revised and expanded into a second edition in 2022, now available to purchase through the [Sycamore Garden Shop](https://shop.sycamore.garden/).
