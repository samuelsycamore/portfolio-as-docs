## Hashnode online writing bootcamp

[Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) is blogging platform for writers in the tech industry.
In 2021, I served as the company's first Marketing Manager.

In my time shaping Hashnode's marketing strategy, it was important to me to establish a culture and an ethos of freely sharing knowledge to help people succeed.

To that end, in late 2021, I organized and hosted a free two-week writing workshop series called [_The Art and Business of Technical Writing_](https://hashnode.com/bootcamp), featuring top content creators in the tech industry.

I wrote all marketing materials for the event, including the landing page as well as the automated email marketing sequence that accompanied the series.

I also landed three paid sponsorships for the bootcamp.

The goal was to get at least 1,000 users to sign up for the event.
In the end we had almost 3,000 signups!
The email marketing campaign had an average open rate above 60%.
The bootcamp led to hundreds of new blog posts being published on the platform.

You can watch the entire series on [Hashnode's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MwCqXbX3A0&list=PL_rXJbw5ZEr0XvY8x5sWxvyS33ul1ChTO).
